# Dokubot
Language of communication: Polish.  
  
## Goal  
The purpose of the work is to create a chatbot system that allows intelligent search of documents. The chatbot should understand the user's commands and respond accordingly.   It was assumed that, receiving a sentence containing requirements from the user, the bot should correctly extract the words that have meaning in the statement. In addition to 
this information, the bot should also understand the logic contained in the received command. Using the information extracted from the sentence about the type and content of the document being sought, the chatbot should search for the document or documents that most closely match the user's requirements.  
Communication should also include attempts to work with the user to resolve problems and ambiguities in the message received from him. Program should include a mechanism for asking the user relevant questions aimed at clarify requirements. In addition to understanding and searching, the chatbot should actively offer the ability to help narrow the search and rank the results according to their fit with the requirements. Communication should take place over the Internet and be conducted in Polish.
